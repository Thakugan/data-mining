# Data Mining
These are my projects for SMU's Intro to Data Mining Course (CSE7331)

### Project 1: Data and Visualization
In this project, I analyzed 4 years of federal employment data during President George W. Bush's and President Barack H. Obama's terms in office to look for trends in the data that reflect policies implemented.
